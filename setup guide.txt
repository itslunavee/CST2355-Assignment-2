Follow these instructions to copy my setup on your PC:

1. Open Command Prompt as Admin
2. Connect as SYSDBA:
	sqlplus / as sysdba
3. Create the user and set password:
	CREATE USER wine_inventory IDENTIFIED BY "YourStrongPassword!123";
4. Grant Privileges:
	GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO wine_inventory;
        GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE, UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO wine_inventory;	
	
5. After that, setup the new connection with this user in Oracle SQL Developer like we did in labs and run the create table and add/alter scripts, then finally the test data. 

6. Once that is done you can run the triggers and procedures, spin up the ODBC connection in Access and begin using the forms and reports.
